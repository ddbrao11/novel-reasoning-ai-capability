## Research Notes
This repository represents ongoing independent research exploration.

## Research Overview
This repository explores approaches toward adaptive AI reasoning
capabilities using structured problem-solving benchmarks.
The goal is to investigate how modern machine learning models
can generalize reasoning strategies across novel tasks rather
than relying solely on pattern memorization.

The work focuses on experimental methodologies and architectural
design choices that support abstraction, generalization, and
flexible problem-solving.

## Research Motivation
General reasoning remains one of the most challenging problems
in artificial intelligence. While current models excel at
pattern recognition, achieving transferable reasoning across
unseen tasks is still an open research question.

## Research Questions
- Can AI systems learn transferable reasoning strategies?
- What architectural components improve abstraction?
- How can models generalize beyond training distributions?

## Approach
Experiments explore structured input representations,
iterative inference workflows, and transformer-based
architectures evaluated using publicly available
benchmark datasets.

## Limitations
Current models may still rely on implicit pattern matching.
Future work may require hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning
approaches or meta-learning frameworks.
